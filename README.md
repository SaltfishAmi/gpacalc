# GpaCalc
Tool to look up grades and calculate the GPA for Southeast Univ. undergraduates.

# Out-of-date
The University updated its campus information system in 2018, and any freshmen who entered the university afterwards will be using the new system, which, this program is **not compatible of**.
At the same time, the campus VPN also got upgraded so it's unsupported either.
This is only for archival purposes, and the possibility that the program get updated is extremely low because the author has already graduated.

# Build
Please use Borland(R) C++Builder 6.0 running on a Windows system whose non-unicode program character coding is set to Simplified Chinese (CP936) to build this.

# Features
Please refer to the Out-of-date section for up-to-date info.
* Calculate the GPA with the specific formula for SEU
* Enter and edit the grades manually
* Connect to the campus information system and retrieve course grade list
* Support the campus reverse VPN
* View your grades with nervousness by scratching a scratch card
* Update your campus information system credentials without your permission (Seriously: any version with this function enabled was explicitly declared upon release)
